# What Defines Happiness?

### [Live Project](https://isabelstoddart.github.io/What-Defines-Happiness/)

The purpose of this project was to consider the context data is collected in. Based on Data Feminism by Catherine Dâ€™Ignazio and Lauren Klein, this project looks at The World Happiness Report and the elements used to define happiness. It examines other aspects of happiness and how those elements compare to the happiness scores of our world. 

The World Happiness Report defines happiness using 6 factors: income, freedom, trust in government, healthy life expectancy, social support from family and friends, and generosity. What does happiness in these countries look like when we change the context and rate it by different factors related to mental health and personal well-being such as LGBTQ+ Rights, Prison Population Rate, Deaths from Drug Use, Deaths from Alcohol Use, and Suicide Rate?
